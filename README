This project is a one off to extract data from a Gnu Cash data file, storing it
an an sqlite3 database.  Once the data is in the sqlite database, the contents are then 
exported into a format we found suitable for importing into compiere.  We're not currently
finished with our migration yet, so there will likely be changes.
